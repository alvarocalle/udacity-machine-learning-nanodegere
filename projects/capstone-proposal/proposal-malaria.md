## Domain Background

According to the <em>World malaria report</em><sup>1</sup>, in 2017, an estimated 219 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide (95% confidence interval [CI]: 203–262 million), compared with 239 million cases in 2010 (95% CI: 219–285 million) and 217 million cases in 2016 (95% CI: 200–259 million).

In 2017, there were an estimated 435 000 deaths from malaria globally, compared with 451000 estimated deaths in 2016, and 607000 in 2010. Nearly 80% of global malaria deaths in 2017 were concentrated in 17 countries in the WHO African Region and India; 7 of these countries accounted for 53% of all global malaria deaths.

Effective surveillance of malaria cases and deaths is essential for identifying the areas or population groups that are most affected by malaria, and for targeting resources for maximum impact. A strong surveillance system requires high levels of access to care and case detection, and complete reporting of health information by all sectors, whether public or private. 

## Problem Statement

The dataset<sup>2</sup> provided by the <em>National Library of Medicine</em><sup>3</sup> will allow us to create a model to detect malaria parasite in thin blood smear images and  reduce the burden for microscopists in resource-constrained regions and improve diagnostic accuracy.


## Datasets and Inputs

The dataset contains a total of 27560 images separated in two folders, Parasitized and Uninfected with 13780 images each.

The images size varies between 49x58 and 349x241
